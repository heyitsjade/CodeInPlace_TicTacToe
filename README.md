# CodeInPlace_TicTacToe
A simple Tic Tac Toe game for 1 player vs AI for my Stanford Code In Place project.  The player goes first and clicks on the grid they want to play.  Then, the simple AI randomly chooses an empty grid to play.  The game goes on until either the player wins, loses, or the game is a draw.
